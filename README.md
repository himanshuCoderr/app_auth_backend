## Project Overview

This project serves as the backend for a user authentication app. It is responsible for handling user registration, login, and interactions with the MongoDB database. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API for communication with the frontend. Security measures include password hashing using bcrypt.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Handles the creation of user accounts by storing user information securely in the database.
- **User Login:** Validates user credentials and generates authentication tokens for authenticated sessions.
- **Database Interactions:** Utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose for storing and retrieving user data.
- **Password Security:** Implements bcrypt for secure password hashing, enhancing user account security.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution.
- **Bcrypt:** A library for hashing passwords securely.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend-repository
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Set up a MongoDB database and update the connection string in the configuration file (`config.js` or similar).
2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /registerPerson:** Register a new user.
- **POST /getRegisteredData:** Log in an existing user.
